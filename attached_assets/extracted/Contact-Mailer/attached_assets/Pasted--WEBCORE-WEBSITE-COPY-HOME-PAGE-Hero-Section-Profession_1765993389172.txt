## WHY YOUR BUSINESS NEEDS A WEBSITE

### Not Having a Website Is Costing You Customers

Today, customers expect to find businesses online. Before calling, visiting, or messaging, most people search first. If your business doesn’t appear — or doesn’t look professional — potential customers move on to a competitor who does.

Without a website, your business:

* Appears less credible than competitors
* Is harder to find on Google
* Loses customers outside of business hours
* Relies only on word-of-mouth
* Misses opportunities every single day

A professional website works for your business 24/7. It builds trust, answers questions, and guides customers to contact you — even when you’re closed.

In today’s market, a website is no longer optional. It’s the foundation of your online presence and a key factor in staying competitive.
